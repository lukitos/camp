                We ourselves are avid campers with a passion for exploring!
                 No one understands more than we do that packing for a camping trip is overwhelming.
                This is why we have decided to do the hard work for you. 
                Inside you will find pre-generated lists according to different types of weather
                as well as one you can create yourself.
